DOCS NO AI

# create a chat ui with chadcn and react native DOCS no AI
-- no websocket yet
# get onto TestFlight ASAP 



# build out design in head while
# adding websocket and chat logic




for the design think 
each integration needs - 
1. a way to integrate
2. a homepage dashboard display box
3. backend and agent access

Workflows 
1. a way to build it easily 
2. access to be modified by agent 
3. a way to edit for user
4. a homepage dashboard display box

Lifestyle integrations - like podcasts 
1. a way to integrate 
2. a dashboard homepage - with a popup to customize change etc. 

idea is to lock into this app only and see everything in one place while being able to see bigger pictures when needed 
this will keep users engaged into staying on the app etc etc
